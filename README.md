This was my submission on the just concluded DSN Business Analytics Track Capstone Project.
Tools used: Excel and Power Bi

Project Summary:

The datasets provide client sales data, Regional, Product, and Client Budgets from the period of Jan 2020 to June 2021. A report that analyses these data sets and provides insight into client behaviour was made.

Result:

The company provides products to 49 regions, making a total sales of 11.05M, selling to 50 Customers.
A line chart over time showed that more sales were generated around the first quarter of the sum years, a drop mid-second quarter, with the least sales from the third quarter. This was because the dataset for 2021 only contained from January to June.
The top 5 selling customers by sales was presented, showing that Prasco group gave the company sales, followed by EI.
The top 5 selling products was also presented, showing that Chocolate Tuffles gave the most sales.
A simple pie chart showed that the AXW291 is the most used warehouse.
A funnel chart showed that the Wholesales Customer type generated more sales compared to other types.
A table compared the total sales of each customer against the allocated budget, and another compared the total sales of each region against their budgets.
